{"1": {"slide_number": 1, "explanation": "The first slide of the presentation talks about a relatively new concept in Python called AsyncIO. This concept is being built into other programming languages like Go, C#, and Scala. It is different from traditional multi-threading or multiprocessing methods and uses cooperative multitasking instead. The slide also emphasizes that AsyncIO is not the same as threading or multiprocessing."}, "2": {"slide_number": 2, "explanation": "The slide presentation compares the differences between threading and asynchronous I/O operations. Threading involves sharing data and resources between tasks, while asynchronous I/O operations do not. Threading can be efficient when tasks share data or resources, while asynchronous I/O operations can be efficient when tasks do not share data or resources. Threading enables concurrency within a process, while asynchronous I/O enables concurrency inside a single thread only when it uses I/O operations. The presentation recommends using asynchronous I/O when possible, and using threading only when necessary."}, "3": {"slide_number": 3, "explanation": "Rate limit exceeded.
